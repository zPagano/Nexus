# Project Nexus: Project Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

This document outlines the high-level phases for the `Nexus` project. In line with our "Sustainability Over Speed" principle, these represent the logical sequence of our development and will be used as our Milestones in GitHub.

---

### **Phase 0: Foundational Setup (Complete)**
* **Goal:** Establish the project's principles, workflow, and a clean, version-controlled codebase on GitHub.

### **Phase 1: Core Models & Roster Analysis (Current Phase)**
* **Goal:** Define the core data structures for our players and accounts. Compile the official list of players to be tracked and perform initial analysis.

### **Phase 2: Data Ingestion Service (V1)**
* **Goal:** Build the first version of the automated service (`Nexus.Ingestion`) that communicates with the Riot API, fetches match data for our tracked players, and saves it.

### **Phase 3: Analysis Engine & Dashboarding**
* **Goal:** Develop the logic to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) from the raw match data. Create the first visual dashboards and reports (our BI prototype).

### **Phase 4: Web UI Development (V1)**
* **Goal:** Build the first version of our custom web interface (`Nexus.Web`) using Blazor, allowing for interactive data exploration.

### **Phase 5: Advanced Analytics (AI/ML Prototyping)**
* **Goal:** Explore the use of Machine Learning models to perform predictive analysis, such as forecasting player performance trends or identifying optimal champion synergies.
